Code Institute: Milestone Project 1

For my first milestone project I decided to design and create an online resume for myself.
I decided to do this while going through the course and being shown how to create a basic resume as one of the mini project and I thought that creating an online resume for myself for give a visual representation of the skills that I am/will be gaining throughout the course with the potential to update it with some of the new skills that I gain along the way.
I also thought that it would be a good way to illustrate my journey to wanting to become a web developer and my future plans of combining my web development, digital marketing, and qualitative analysis skills.

Main Aims:
* To provide a 


Design Process:
As my website is a resume I wanted it to resemble my original word file resume but add character to give an insight to the type of personality that I have.
Of course not all information from my CV could go on the webpage and this led me to highlight what I believed to be the most important and relevant aspects to employers and clients that may want me to work with them on their project.
From this I chose my 'About Me' page which has my qualifications at the forefront and a section to get more in depth details, Key SKills that would be relevant to the role that I would be working in, examples of projects so that an employer can see my work, and information for me to be contacted directly.

My first design choice was to have all sections on one page for easy navigation and to resemble and actual CV. This meant that it was important for my navigation menu to respond to the different sections in my page.
This lef me to think about the header as that is where the navigation menu would be and I wanted it to match my footer. Puple is my favourite color and I wanted a somewhat 'girly' feel to the page so felt that a gradient to the footer with some italic font would give that impression.

I started creating my wireframe on figma. I experimented with different page layouts, fonts and color combinations for my page and each of its sections. I wanted the puple to stand out so I found that white and black complimented it better than my original color combination of purple and light blue. i used grey in one sectiono fmy page to break up the black and white which worked well too.
I found a purple that was vibrant and not to overpowering and decided on the font Romanesco for heading and the menu.
You can find my figma wireframe here: https://www.figma.com/file/0u0YxVykDkJJIM436htqWu/UCD-Milestone-Project-1-Plan?node-id=0%3A1

As you will see I wasn't able to finish my website completely. I had a lot of problems with my workspace not responding and css and html not cooperating for some time so throughout my project I had to simplify it quite a lot. If I had mmore time it would look like my wireframes completely.


Features left to implement:
The features that I have left to implement are the icons for my contact details and my qualifications, future projects that can be clicked on as examples of projects I have done, a youtube video of a project that I have worked on, and more information when clicking the more details button underneath my qualifications.
I did think to add a section for feedback or references from people that I would have worked with but thought that feature could be added once I had the example projects on display.

Technologies Used:
* HTML5 - the language used to create the layout and information on the website
* CSS3 - The language used to style html elements in terms of position and color
* Bootstrap framework - I used some of bootstraps grid container system to help with responsive deisng
* Figma - I used figma to deisgn my wireframes for my website which included deciding on layout, font, color, pictures, icons and links.
* Google fonts - I used this to import the Romanesco font that I found while using figma.
* Stack Overflow - Although not a technology stack overflow guided me on making my responsive navigation menu.

Issues found:
Although making the form was easy it was the main element that I found the most difficult to make responsive (as I'm sure you will see) and unfortunately I ran out of time to fix this issue.
I also found resizing some of my pictures quite difficult and I had to play around with a lot of commands in order to find out which command worked best for each image.
I also found making my website more responsive first. I believe this is because I didn't focus enough on my mobile first design. In future projects I would pay more attention to the mobile first designa dn make much better use of bootstrap which is designed with the mobile first approach.

Deploying my project:
I created my project on GitHub and used Gitpods development software to write my code. I make my code accessible to others I have deployed my project on GitHub Pages.
