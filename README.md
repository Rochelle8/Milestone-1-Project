This project is a Resume for myself as a Full Stack Web Developer and Digital Marketer.

I didn't have enough time to add media queries to my design to make it mobile device responsive due to having issues with my css and html file responding to each other.
If you look at my css code you will see that various properties are no longer responding in my browser and I have spent a lot of time trying to fix this and having no luck.
It was responding and my website was looking how I wanted it to but then for some reason the server has stopped picking up some of my css code i.e. my projects images have been coded with a border-radius of 50% for a circular image and this is no longer displaying on the browser.
